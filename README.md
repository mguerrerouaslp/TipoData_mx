# TipoData_mx

## Description

This project aims to comprehensively and meticulously address the analysis of Mexican typographic production over a period of 25 years. The inherent complexity of typographic evolution requires a systematic approach, and our exhaustive mapping methods will provide a faithful and detailed representation of the multiple facets that make up this field.

Identifying trends will delve into conceptual and contextual aspects, considering the interaction with socioeconomic, technological, and cultural factors that may have influenced their development.

This repository contains files that constitute the indexing system of the Mexican typographic production to the database for its subsequent analysis.
